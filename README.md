* A car was integrated with a camera that helps capture live feed from the roadside. Once the speed limit boards (30, 60, and 90) are detected and the car crosses the board, it will maintain a constant speed according to the speed limit on the roadside. This system will prevent accidents caused by vehicles speeding.

* Initially, the YOLO model is created and its performance is tested using the webcam to check the model's accuracy.

YOLOv8-M is an advanced real-time object detection model that builds upon the YOLO series. It features:

* State-of-the-art backbone and neck architectures.
* An anchor-free split Ultralytics head for improved accuracy and efficiency.
* Optimized tradeoff between accuracy and speed.
* Pre-trained variants specialized for detection, segmentation, pose estimation, classification, and oriented object detection.
