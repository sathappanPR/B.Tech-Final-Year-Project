* A car was integrated with a camera that helps capture live feed from the roadside. Once the speed limit boards (30, 60, and 90) are detected and the car crosses the board, it will maintain a constant speed according to the speed limit on the roadside. This system will prevent accidents caused by vehicles speeding.
